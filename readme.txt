Hi, thanks for checking out my CommitTracker!

For this, you will need some program that can process server requests like xampp and an sql database
Please edit the "dbConn.php" to fit your sql server accordingly
After, load the page for "databaseFunctions.php"
Finally, just load the index page and it should work

Thanks for using my code! If you have any questions or issues, feel free to email me at nicholas.braniff@live.com; I'll try to help as best as I can.
